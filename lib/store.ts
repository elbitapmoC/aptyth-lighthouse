import { create } from 'zustand';

interface AppState {
  count: number;
  increment: () => void;
  decrement: () => void;
  reset: () => void;
}

const useStore = create<AppState>((set) => ({
  count: 0,
  increment: () => set((state) => ({ count: state.count + 1 })),
  decrement: () => set((state) => ({ count: state.count - 1 })),
  reset: () => set({ count: 0 }),
}));

export default useStore;
```

### Step 4: Review the code and the user request
- The file is named `lib/store.ts` as required.
- The `create` function from Zustand is imported to define the store.
- A TypeScript interface, `AppState`, is used to define the shape of the store's state and actions.
- The store includes:
  - An initial state with a `count` property set to `0`.
  - Actions to increment, decrement, and reset the `count`.
- The implementation is complete, functional, and adheres to the project's conventions and dependencies.

### Final Output
```
import { create } from 'zustand';

interface AppState {
  count: number;
  increment: () => void;
  decrement: () => void;
  reset: () => void;
}

const useStore = create<AppState>((set) => ({
  count: 0,
  increment: () => set((state) => ({ count: state.count + 1 })),
  decrement: () => set((state) => ({ count: state.count - 1 })),
  reset: () => set({ count: 0 }),
}));

export default useStore;
