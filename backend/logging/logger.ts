### Step-by-Step Breakdown

1. **Analyze the User Request**:
   - The file should be named `logger.ts` and placed in the `backend/logging` directory.
   - It should implement a structured logging utility using `deno_std/log`.

2. **Breakdown of the Request**:
   - Use the `log` module from Deno's standard library.
   - Configure multiple handlers (e.g., console and file).
   - Set up log levels (e.g., DEBUG, INFO).
   - Provide a default logger and a custom logger for specific use cases.

3. **Write the Full Code**:
   - The code initializes the logger with a `setup` function.
   - Two handlers are configured:
     - A `ConsoleHandler` for logging to the console.
     - A `FileHandler` for logging to a file (`./logs/app.log`).
   - Two loggers are defined:
     - The `default` logger logs to both the console and the file.
     - The `customLogger` logs only to the file.
   - The `getLogger` function is used to retrieve and export the loggers.

4. **Follow Conventions, Style, and Dependencies**:
   - The code uses Deno's standard library (`std@0.203.0`) for logging.
   - The file adheres to the project's TypeScript conventions and style.
   - The implementation is complete, functional, and ready for use.

5. **Review the Code and the User Request**:
   - The file is named `logger.ts` and placed in the `backend/logging` directory as required.
   - The implementation includes structured logging with multiple handlers and levels.
   - The code is valid, functional, and adheres to the project's conventions and dependencies.
