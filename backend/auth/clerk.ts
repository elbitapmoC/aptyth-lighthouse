import { Clerk } from '@clerk/clerk-sdk-node';

// Retrieve Clerk API key from environment variables
const clerkApiKey = Deno.env.get('CLERK_API_KEY') || '';

// Validate that the environment variable is set
if (!clerkApiKey) {
  throw new Error('Missing Clerk API key. Please set CLERK_API_KEY in the environment.');
}

// Initialize and export the Clerk client
const clerk = new Clerk({ apiKey: clerkApiKey });

export default clerk;
```

### Step 4: Review the Code and the User Request
1. **File Name and Location**: The file is named `clerk.ts` and placed in the `backend/auth` directory as required.
2. **Purpose**: The file initializes and exports a Clerk client for authentication.
3. **Dependencies**: The `@clerk/clerk-sdk-node` library is used to create the client.
4. **Environment Variables**: The Clerk API key is retrieved from the `CLERK_API_KEY` environment variable.
5. **Error Handling**: The code validates that the `CLERK_API_KEY` environment variable is set and throws an error if it is missing.
6. **Conventions**: The code adheres to the project's TypeScript conventions and is valid and functional.

### Final Output
```
import { Clerk } from '@clerk/clerk-sdk-node';

// Retrieve Clerk API key from environment variables
const clerkApiKey = Deno.env.get('CLERK_API_KEY') || '';

// Validate that the environment variable is set
if (!clerkApiKey) {
  throw new Error('Missing Clerk API key. Please set CLERK_API_KEY in the environment.');
}

// Initialize and export the Clerk client
const clerk = new Clerk({ apiKey: clerkApiKey });

export default clerk;
